   assignment4Application.cpp - application file for a program named assignment4
   =============================================================================

   This program is for Assignment No. 4, Course 04-630 Data Structures and Algorithms for Engineers. 

   Text Analysis using Binary Search Trees.

   The functionality of the program is defined as follows.

   Read in the the words file which is the dictionary that contains all words and then read in the first testfile from the input file. 

   The Binary Search Tree(BST) ADT was  used in implementing this solution since, it has do with constructing 2 trees of words in the word file 
   and test file, by implementing the BST functions of getTreeHeight and size, we were able to compute the getTreeHeight and size of the BST respectively.

   The output file will contain a set of data computed from the input text files we were given.

   Input data with the words file and textfiles that will be used for testing is provided in an input file named input.txt.
   The first line is the relative path of the words.txt file. It is followed by the location of the textfiles to be tested with, one line per textfiles.

   This input file is located in the data directory. Since this directory is a sibling directory of the bin directory 
   where the example .exe file resides, the filename used when opening the file is "../data/input.txt".

   Output for the test case is written to an output file "../data/output.txt"


   Input
   -----

   -  Dictionary file and text files that contains sentences or words to be checked from the dictionary.

   Solution Strategy
   -----------------

   The input parameters were read in and stored in variables. The parameters were converted to the right units required for simulation.
   A function was implemented to saple a Poisson distribution, which was then used in our main program to simulate the number of cars
   that arrived at any interval during the runtime(in ms) given in the input file.
   A queue data structure with its enqueue and dequeue functions was implented to store the arrival time of cars and the number of cars that arrived.
   Cars were added to the queue based on the count of cars returned by the samplePoisson() function, the total numbers of cars that arrived
   was tracked. 
   
   Decalre variables to store the input parameters.
   read_in(all input parameters) for each testcase/simulation





	write the output to the file
   Repeat the process from read_in() for another test case until there is no more test case to test with in the input file.

   Test Strategy
   -------------

   The program has been tested with a variety of test data sets that reflect all valid conditions, including boundary conditions:
   1. Test with normal words.
   2. Test with repeated words in one file.
   3. Test with words that have multiple non-alphanumeric characters.
   4. Test with words that have hyphen.
   5. Test with words that have apostrophe and a character after it.
   - 

   The order of complexity
   -----------------------
   An insertion sort was used to sort our queue outside the main simualation loop. Insertion sort has a worst case Big O of O(n^2). 
   The sort function was called three times.
   The algorithm for this solution was implemented in 4 main steps: read, simulate, sort and write the data.
   Read and write have a big O of O(n) but the simulation has a Big O of O(n^3). The simulation loop had an internal loop which 
   was used to add cars to the queue by using the queue function(enqeue). The enqueue function which also based on the LinkedList ADT
   implementation has a big O of O(n). Hence the Big O of the whole algorithm is going to be O(n^3).


   File organization
   -----------------

   assignment4Interface.h           interface file:      
									contains the declarations required to use the functions that implement the solution to this problem
									typically, these will include the definitions of the abstract data types used in the implementation

   assignment4Implementation.cpp	implementation file: 
									contains the definitions of the functions that implement the algorithms used in the implementation
 
   assignment4Application.cpp		application file:    
									contains the code that instantiates the abstract data types and calls the associated functions
									in order to effect the required functionality for this application
