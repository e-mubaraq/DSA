For each file, compile a list of all distinct correctly-spelled words by reading them from the
file and inserting them in a binary search tree (BST). When all the words have been read from
that file, traverse the BST and write the words to an output file, one word per line, in
alphabetic order, together with the number of occurrences of each word in the file and, in
brackets, the level at which they are stored in the BST. Remember, the root of the tree is at
level 0. Your program should be case-insensitive, i.e. it should treat “Tree” and “tree” as the
same word.
