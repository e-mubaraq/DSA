   assignment1Application.cpp - application file for a program named assignment1
   =============================================================================

   This program is for Assignment No. 1, Course 04-630 Data Structures and Algorithms for Engineers. 

   The functionality of the program is defined as follows.
   
   Read location data and time from an input file, process it, and assign unique id for each unique location.
   The output file will contain a block of unique ids with corresponding time, x and y-coordinates.

   A function is used to prepend the text and write the message to the output file.

   Input data with a test case message is provided in an input file named input.txt.  
   This input file is located in the data directory. Since this directory is a sibling directory of the bin directory 
   where the example .exe file resides, the filename used when opening the file is "../data/input.txt".

   Output for the test case is written to an output file "../data/output.txt"


   Input
   -----

   - A block of numbers representing the time, x and y coordinates of the Ant's movement.


   Output
   ------

   - A block of numbers representing the unique id, t and unique x and y coordinates.
 

   Sample Input
   ------------
   
    2
	0.000 0.000 0.000
	0.100 0.050 0.000
	0.200 0.100 0.000
	0.300 0.190 0.000

   Sample Output
   -------------
    mmikail
	1 0.000 0 0
	2 1.100 0 1
	3 1.400 0 2
	4 1.600 0 4
	5 1.800 0 5

   Solution Strategy
   -----------------

   The data was read in and stored in variables. An array of struct was defined which was used to store the data read in from the file.
   A unique id was assigned by checking that no two lines have the same x and y values after the x and y values have been converted
   to int.

   Test Strategy
   -------------

   The program has been tested with a variety of test data sets that reflect all valid conditions, including boundary conditions:

   - 



   File organization
   -----------------

    assignment1Interface.h          interface file:      
									contains the declarations required to use the functions that implement the solution to this problem
									typically, these will include the definitions of the abstract data types used in the implementation

   assignment1Implementation.cpp	implementation file: 
									contains the definitions of the functions that implement the algorithms used in the implementation
 
   assignment1Application.cpp		application file:    
									contains the code that instantiates the abstract data types and calls the associated functions
									in order to effect the required functionality for this application
