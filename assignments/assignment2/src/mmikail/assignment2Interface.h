   File organization
   -----------------

    assignment1Interface.h          interface file:      
									contains the declarations required to use the functions that implement the solution to this problem
									typically, these will include the definitions of the abstract data types used in the implementation

   assignment1Implementation.cpp	implementation file: 
									contains the definitions of the functions that implement the algorithms used in the implementation
 
   assignment1Application.cpp		application file:    
									contains the code that instantiates the abstract data types and calls the associated functions
									in order to effect the required functionality for this application

   - Added prompt_and_exit() to allow users to read the terminal messages before it is closed.  David Vernon, 06/01/2019.
   - Added store_location() to return a unique id for each location the ants passed through.	Mubarak Mikail	21/01/2019.
   - Added reset_id() to reset the id to 1 at the end of every test case before processing another test case.	Mubarak Mikail 29/01/2019
