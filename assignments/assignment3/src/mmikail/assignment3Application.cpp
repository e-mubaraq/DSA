   assignment3Application.cpp - application file for a program named assignment3
   =============================================================================

   This program is for Assignment No. 3, Course 04-630 Data Structures and Algorithms for Engineers. 

   Simulation of Queueing Behaviour at Traffic Lights.

   The functionality of the program is defined as follows.

   Read in the sets of seven simulation parameters: arrival rate, departure rate, running time, time increment, red light duration, amber light
   duration and green light duration from the input file. Ensure they are or converted to the correct units to be used for the simulation.

   Because this problem is a probabilistic problem, we modelled it using Poisson distribution by writing a function that uses the arrival_rate 
   of a car to simulate the number of cars that arrive at every interval of our simulation. 

   The Queue ADT was also used in implementing this solution since, it has do with cars arriving and leaving a traffic light, by implementing 
   the queue functions of enqueue and dequeue, we were able to add and remove a car from the back and the front of the queue respectively.

   The output file will contain a set of statistical data computed from the input parameters we were given.

   Input data with the total number of test cases is provided in an input file named input.txt.
   The first line is the number of testcases or simulation scenarios. It is followed by N sets of seven key-value pairs, each pair specifying the 
   input parameter and its value. The key-value pairs can appear in any order. There will be only one key-value pair for each parameter.

   This input file is located in the data directory. Since this directory is a sibling directory of the bin directory 
   where the example .exe file resides, the filename used when opening the file is "../data/input.txt".

   Output for the test case is written to an output file "../data/output.txt"

   Solution Strategy
   -----------------

   The input parameters were read in and stored in variables. The parameters were converted to the right units required for simulation.
   A function was implemented to saple a Poisson distribution, which was then used in our main program to simulate the number of cars
   that arrived at any interval during the runtime(in ms) given in the input file.
   A queue data structure with its enqueue and dequeue functions was implented to store the arrival time of cars and the number of cars that arrived.
   Cars were added to the queue based on the count of cars returned by the samplePoisson() function, the total numbers of cars that arrived
   was tracked. 
   
   Certain conditions were also checked by using a depature timer to see if a car can leave and then call the dequeue() function to remove a car from the queue. 
   The waiting time of the car that was dequeued was noted which is the difference between the current simulation time and the arrival time
   of the car as gotten from the queue element. The total of the waiting time was also kept track of. Everytime a car is dequeued or enqueued, a
   counter (queue_length) was decremented or incremented so as to be able to keep track of the queue length during any simulation period.
   
   The queue length for each interval is stored in an array, so that I can be able to find the median queue length that will be 
   written to the output file. In getting the maximum queue legth, the current queue length is compared with the maximum queue length, if it is greater,
   it is used to replace the maximum queue length. The current queue length is added to a running total of the queue length, this will be used to
   compute the average queue length for that simulation.

   A light timer was also kept to check the times when the light is supposed to change colors and effect the change. Initial state of the light is red.
   The timer is reset to zero after every change of state. 

   Aftert the simualtion, the queue was checked to see if there are no cars waiting(that is still in the queue). If the queue is not empty, all the cars 
   left on the queue are dequeued while keeping track of their waiting time and adding it to the running total.


   Decalre variables to store the input parameters.
   read_in(all input parameters) for each testcase/simulation
   Loop through the simulation period:
		call the samplePoisson() function
		Loop through the returned value(count) of the samplePoisson() function
			enqueue(e, list)
			increment the queue length
		increment the total_number_of_cars by count
		Check if the depature_timer is greater than the depature_time per car and the light is green:
			dequeue(list)
			decrement the queue length
			compute the waiting time of each of the car dequeued (wait_time = current time - arrival time stored in the queue)
			add this waiting time to the running total of waiting time.
			check if the current wait time is greater than the maximum wait time, replace it.
			reset the depature_timer to zero
		store the current queue length in an array and increment the number of queue length by 1
		check if the current queue length is greater than the maximum queue length, replace it.
		increment the total queue length by queue length
		check the light state and light timer to be able to change the state of the light
		if light is green and the light timer > than green duration:
			set light to amber and reset light timer
		if light is amber and the light timer > than amber duration:
			set light to red and reset light timer
		if light is red and the light timer > than red duration:
			set light to amber and reset light timer and depature timer
	check if there are cars left on the queue:
		dequeue them and compute waiting time
		add this waiting time to the running total of waiting time.
	Compute the required statistics to be written to the output file.
		avg_wait_time = total_wait_time / total_number_of_cars;
		avg_queue_length = total_queue_length / num_of_queue_length;

		sort the array of queue length in order to find the median queue length which is the middle element in the array
		if ((num_of_queue_length % 2) != 0)
		median_queue_length = qu_lengths[(num_of_queue_length / 2) + 1];
		else 
		median_queue_length = (qu_lengths[num_of_queue_length / 2] + qu_lengths[(num_of_queue_length / 2) + 1]) / 2;

	write the output to the file
   Repeat the process from read_in() for another test case until there is no more test case to test with in the input file.

   Test Strategy
   -------------

   The program has been tested with a variety of test data sets that reflect all valid conditions, including boundary conditions:
   1. Test with different values of the input parameters.
   2. Test with input parameters such that the order of the parameters of the file is different from the previous.
   3. Test with a red_time_duration of 0 and a high green_time_duration
   4. Test with a green_time_duration of 0
   5. Test with a low green_time_duration and a high red_time_duration
   - 

   The order of complexity
   -----------------------
   An insertion sort was used to sort our queue outside the main simualation loop. Insertion sort has a worst case Big O of O(n^2). 
   The sort function was called three times.
   The algorithm for this solution was implemented in 4 main steps: read, simulate, sort and write the data.
   Read and write have a big O of O(n) but the simulation has a Big O of O(n^3). The simulation loop had an internal loop which 
   was used to add cars to the queue by using the queue function(enqeue). The enqueue function which also based on the LinkedList ADT
   implementation has a big O of O(n). Hence the Big O of the whole algorithm is going to be O(n^3).
